			<h2>PART TWO</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“....To illustrate: Once young Jean C—— came to me after a month of diligent investigation on a difficult assignment. He wore a forlorn expression. Without a word he handed me a slip of official paper. I read it in surprise. It was his resignation.</p>
				<p>“‘Here, Jean!’ I cried. ‘What is the meaning of this?’</p>
				<p>“‘I have failed, M. Brillon,’ he muttered. ‘A month’s work, gone to the devil. I have been on the wrong track. It is a disgrace.’</p>
				<p>“‘Jean, my friend,’ said I solemnly, ‘this for your resignation.’ Wherewith I tore it to hits before his astonished eyes. ‘Go now,’ I admonished him, ‘and begin from the beginning. For remember always the maxim: He who would know right must first know wrong!’”</p>
				<p>—From Reminiscences of a Prefect,<br/>
				By Auguste Brillon.</p>
