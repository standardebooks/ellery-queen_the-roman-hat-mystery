					<p>“.⁠ ⁠… To illustrate: Once young Jean C⁠⸺ came to me after a month of diligent investigation on a difficult assignment. He wore a forlorn expression. Without a word he handed me a slip of official paper. I read it in surprise. It was his resignation.</p>
					<p>“ ‘Here, Jean!’ I cried. ‘What is the meaning of this?’</p>
					<p>“ ‘I have failed, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.</abbr> Brillon,’ he muttered. ‘A month’s work, gone to the devil. I have been on the wrong track. It is a disgrace.’</p>
					<p>“ ‘Jean, my friend,’ said I solemnly, ‘this for your resignation.’ Wherewith I tore it to hits before his astonished eyes. ‘Go now,’ I admonished him, ‘and begin from the beginning. For remember always the maxim: He who would know right must first know wrong!’ ”</p>
