			<h2>PART THREE</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“A good detective is born, not made. Like all genius, he springs not from a carefully nurtured <i lang="de">polizei</i> but from all mankind. The most amazing detective I ever knew was a dirty old witch-doctor who had never been out of the bush.... It is the peculiar gift of the truly great detective that he can apply to the inexorable rules of logic three catalyzers: an abnormal observation of events, a knowledge of the human mind and an insight into the human heart.”</p>
				<p>—From The Man-Hunter’s Manual,<br/>
				By James Redix (the Younger).</p>
