				<img alt="A purported hand drawn map of the Roman Theater, with capital letters on it to denote various areas of interest. The lobby is at the bottom of the map, the stage at the top. The lobby has the letter N in two enclosed areas with doors onto the lobby, one on the far left, the other on the far right. An area marked “Rear” is directly above the lobby, with the letter H in a rectangular area with a door, the letter I in a rectangular area with a door below H, and the letter J in a smaller area to the right of I with a door. The letter K is a little to the right of center at the back by a small square, the letter L is to the right of it by some stairs, and the letter M all the way to the right and further up, also by some stairs. The theater seats, in three sections, begin above the Rear area, and continue all the way to the stage. On the left and right of the seating area are alleyways; in both of these alleyways, about half-way up, is the letter F, each in front of an exit. In the very last row of seating in the left section, the letter P is to the right-center of the row. The two rows in front of that one have the individual seats drawn, with the letter G to the left. Four rows further up, the letter E is on the far left seat of the center section. Five rows up from there, the letter D is to the left of the two far left seats in the left section. Nine further rows up, the letter B is next to the third seat from the right in the left section, and the letter C is to the left of the second seat from the right in the center section. There are orchestra boxes on the left and right sides of the far front of the seating area; each of them has the letter Q in them. On the top left of the map, the letter A is in an enclosed area that has one door onto the stage and one onto the alleyway. On the top right, there is a similar area with the letter O, but it only has a door onto the stage." src="../images/illustration-1.svg"/>
